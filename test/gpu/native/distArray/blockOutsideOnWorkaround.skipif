# with aod, the access to arr's elements are handled with a get. However, it
# looks like we're probably taking the local access path, or more specifically,
# the wide pointer pointing to the array element has `-2` sublocale, that
# results in attempting to `chpl_memmove` whereas this should have resulted in a
# device to host copy.
